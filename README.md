### Hello! I'm Parrot! Coding is (mostly) just a hobby of mine.
I primarily dabble in web development, but have been bridging over into Unity modding as of recent. ~~arch btw~~  
My current day-to-day job is [streaming on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/theblackparrot), which gives me ample time to work on some cool stuff. Most of it I use on stream!

I'm comfortable using:
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Python
- C#
- Lua

### Streaming overlays:
The overlays I use on my stream are all my own, and I allow the public to use [a few of them](https://theblackparrot.me/overlays). Code for all of them is available [here](https://github.com/TheBlackParrot-Streaming-Overlays). They are designed with self-hosting in mind, you don't have to use the version I host if you don't want to.

Oh also: **Vibe coding is bad and you should definitely feel bad for doing it.** Learn to figure out what your code is doing, so that *when* something breaks, you *yourself* have an idea on what to do to fix it. Relying on noise being shaped to the results you want is only going to get you so far.
